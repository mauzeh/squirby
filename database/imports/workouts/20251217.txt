Every 3 min x 5 sets:

2-3 Deadlifts, build per set
10-12 Cal Cardio
3 Tabata Circuits:

8 x 20sec WORK, 10 sec REST
One station all the way through:
1) Single Leg DB RDL (alt sides per round)
2) Elbow Plank Rainbow Hip Dips
3) Ball Slams
So you stay at one movement all 8 rounds (4min) before moving to the next. 12min total. Rainbow hip dip demo here.

Notes: Week 3 of 3 in our short EOY Strength block. Build to a heavy 1 to 3 reps of deadlifts across the 5 sets.
