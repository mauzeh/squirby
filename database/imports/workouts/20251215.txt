Every 3 min x 5 sets:

1-3 Back Squats, build per set
8-10 Deadbug w/2s pause (/side)
In 15 Minutes:

100-80-60-40 Double Unders 
25 KB Swings after each set
Then Max Cals in Remaining Time
So 100 DUs, 25 swings, then 80 DUs, 25 swings, then 60/25, 40/25, then in whatever time is left accumulate as many cals as you can!

Notes: Week 3 of 3 in our short EOY Strength block. Build to a heavy 1 to 3 reps of back squats across the 5 sets.
