Every 3 min. x 5 sets:

1-3 Strict Press, build per set 
8-10 DB Tripod Row (/side)
6 Rounds For Time:

8 Single Arm Push Press (/side)
8 V-Ups or Toes-To-Bar 
8 Box Step-Ups 
200m Run
Gotta move quick on this one if you want to finish in the 15min time cap! If you know this will take you considerably longer, then consider reducing the reps by 1-2 each movement.

Notes: Week 3 of 3 in our short EOY Strength block. Build to a heavy 1 to 3 reps of strict presses across the 5 sets.
