9/8/2025,10:45 AM,Strict Press,120,5,1,Failed on the second set. Left shoulder did not feel great and stopped working a little. I think it’s because of the weekend as well as the new arm position on the back squat is pinching something. So I switched to dumbbells maybe I will stick just with those for a while.
