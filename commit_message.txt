feat(admin): Allow admins to promote user exercises to global

This commit introduces a new feature that allows administrators to promote personal, user-created exercises to global status, making them available to all users.

The key changes are as follows:

- **`app/Http/Controllers/ExerciseController.php`:**
  - A new `promoteSelected` method has been added to handle the promotion of selected exercises.

- **`app/Policies/ExercisePolicy.php`:**
  - A `promoteToGlobal` policy has been implemented to ensure that only administrators can promote exercises.

- **`resources/views/exercises/index.blade.php`:**
  - A "Promote" button and form have been added to the exercises index page, visible only to users with the 'Admin' role.
  - Client-side validation has been added to ensure that only user-owned exercises can be selected for promotion.

- **`routes/web.php`:**
  - A new `exercises/promote-selected` route has been added to handle the promotion requests.

- **`tests/Unit/ExercisePolicyTest.php`:**
  - New tests have been added to verify the `promoteToGlobal` policy, ensuring that the promotion functionality is restricted to admins and that already-global exercises cannot be promoted again.
