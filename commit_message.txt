feat(admin): Implement admin-managed exercises and TSV import

This commit introduces a comprehensive feature set for administrators to manage exercises within the application. It also adds support for importing exercises from TSV files, enhancing the data management capabilities for admins.

Key features and changes in this commit include:

- **Admin-Managed Exercises:**
    - Administrators now have full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for exercises.
    - This is enforced through a new `ExercisePolicy` that restricts access to these actions to users with the 'admin' role.
    - The `ExerciseController` has been updated to handle these new administrative functions.

- **TSV Import for Exercises:**
    - A new `TsvImporterService` has been introduced to handle the import of exercises from TSV files.
    - This service is integrated into the `ExerciseController` to allow admins to upload and process TSV files.
    - The service includes detailed error messaging for failed imports.

- **UI Improvements:**
    - A password visibility toggle has been added to the login and user creation/edit forms.
    - The exercises index page now includes a banner that does not wrap, improving the layout.
    - The UI for creating and editing exercises has been updated to support the new admin features.

- **Testing:**
    - A significant number of new tests have been added to cover the new functionality, including:
        - Feature tests for exercise management, TSV import, and user badge display.
        - Unit tests for the `ExercisePolicy`, `Exercise` model, and `TsvImporterService`.
        - Integration tests for the `GlobalExercisesSeeder` and TSV import with global exercises.

- **Kiro Specs:**
    - This commit implements the requirements outlined in the following Kiro specifications:
        - `admin-managed-exercises`
        - `exercise-tsv-import-admin-support`
        - `password-visibility-toggle`
        - `exercise-index-banner-nowrap`
