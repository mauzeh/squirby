### **The Philosophy: High-Frequency Squatting 🧠**

* **Day 1 (Heavy):** This is your primary strength-building day. You'll push for progressive overload on your top sets.  
* **Day 2 (Light):** The focus here is on speed, recovery, and perfect technique. The weight is significantly reduced to allow your nervous system and joints to recover while still practicing the movement pattern.  
* **Day 3 (Medium/Volume):** This day bridges the gap. The weight is lighter than your heavy day, but the total volume (sets x reps) is higher to stimulate muscle growth (hypertrophy), which will support future strength gains.

### **The Revised 3-Day Program (High-Frequency Squat)**

#### **Day 1: Heavy Squat & Bench Focus**

* **Main Lift:** **Barbell Back Squat (Heavy)**  
  * Work up to a top set of **3 sets of 5 reps (3x5)**.  
  * This is your main progression lift for the week. Add 5 lbs to this lift whenever you successfully complete all sets and reps.  
* **Secondary Lift:** **Barbell Bench Press**  
  * Perform **3 sets of 5 reps (3x5)**.  
* **Accessory Work:**  
  * **Zombie Squats 3 sets of 8-12 reps.**  
  * **Pendlay Rows:** **3 sets of 8 reps (3x8)**.  
  * **Romanian Deadlifts (RDLs):** **3 sets of 8-10 reps**. Use a lighter weight and focus on hamstring stretch. This builds the posterior chain without the heavy spinal load of a deadlift, which is ideal for a heavy squat day.  
  * **Plank:** **3 sets, hold for 45-60 seconds**.

#### **Day 2: Light Squat & Overhead Press Focus**

* **Main Lift:** **Barbell Back Squat (Light/Speed)**  
  * Perform **2 sets of 5 reps (2x5)** using **75-80% of the weight** you used on your Day 1 heavy squat.  
  * The focus is on explosive concentric movement (coming out of the hole) and perfect form. Do NOT train to failure.  
* **Secondary Lift:** **Overhead Press (OHP)**  
  * Perform **3 sets of 5 reps (3x5)**.  
* **Accessory Work:**  
  * **Zombie Squats 3 sets of 8-12 reps.**  
  * **Lat Pulldowns or Pull-ups:** **3 sets of 8-12 reps**.  
  * **Dumbbell Incline Press:** **3 sets of 8-12 reps**.  
  * **Face Pulls:** **3 sets of 15-20 reps**. Non-negotiable for shoulder health.  
  * **Bicep Curls:** **3 sets of 10-12 reps**.

#### **Day 3: Volume Squat & Deadlift Focus**

* **Main Lift:** **Barbell Back Squat (Volume)**  
  * Perform **5 sets of 5 reps (5x5)** using **85-90% of the weight** from your Day 1 heavy squat.  
  * The goal is to accumulate volume and build muscle. The last couple of sets should be challenging.  
* **Secondary Lift:** **Conventional Deadlift**  
  * Work up to one heavy top set of **1 set of 5 reps (1x5)**.  
  * This will feel heavy after the volume squats. Focus intently on your setup and maintaining a flat back.  
* **Accessory Work:**  
  * **Zombie Squats 3 sets of 8-12 reps.**  
  * **Glute-Ham Raises or Leg Curls:** **3 sets of 10-15 reps**. Isolate the hamstrings.  
  * **Dumbbell Rows:** **3 sets of 10-12 reps per arm**.  
  * **Hanging Leg Raises:** **3 sets to failure**.
