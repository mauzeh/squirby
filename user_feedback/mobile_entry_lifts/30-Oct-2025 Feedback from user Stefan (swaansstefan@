it’s a bit cumbersome to try to add sets at different weights for the same exercise, have to go and add in each one manually, lots of clicks
when i click the sets or reps field to type something in, i want it to auto highlight the text so i don’t have to press backspace first 
the + and - buttons shouldn’t be highlightable because if i click them rapidly they just get highlighted instead of pressing 
any number should be acceptable for weight, not just increments of 5
the interface for adding an exercise not already in the drop down menu is not intuitive, i expected to press + and then add the exercise name, not the other way around (since the bar says “search”)
maybe this already exists and i just didn’t look for it, but it would be nice to have existing exercise routines already filled out where i just modify the weight rep and set numbers
