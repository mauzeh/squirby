# Workout Templates - Quick Start Guide

## What Are Workout Templates?

Workout templates let you save your favorite workout routines and reuse them with one click. Instead of manually adding the same exercises every week, create a template once and apply it whenever you need it.

## Quick Start

### 1. View Your Templates
Navigate to: **Lifts → Templates**

You'll see a table of all your templates with:

### 2. Create a New Template

1. Click **"Create New Template"**
2. Enter a name (e.g., "Push Day", "Leg Day")

### 3. Add Exercises to Your Template

After creating a template, you'll see the edit page:

1. Enter an exercise name (e.g., "Bench Press")
2. Click **"Add Exercise"**
3. Repeat for all exercises in your workout

The exercises will appear in a table below the form in priority order. The first exercise added has the highest priority.

## Tips

### Creating Effective Templates

1. **Name them clearly** - Use descriptive names like "Push Day" or "Monday Workout"
2. **Add descriptions** - Note the focus or difficulty level
3. **Order matters** - Add exercises in the order you'll perform them
4. **Start simple** - Begin with 3-5 exercises per template

### Using Templates Effectively

1. **Create variations** - Make "Heavy" and "Light" versions of the same workout
2. **Plan your week** - Create templates for each training day (Push/Pull/Legs)
3. **Adjust after applying** - Templates are starting points; modify weights as needed
4. **Track what works** - Keep templates that lead to good progress

### Common Use Cases

**Push/Pull/Legs Split:**
- Create 3 templates: Push Day, Pull Day, Leg Day
- Rotate through them 2x per week

**Full Body Routine:**
- Create 2-3 full body templates
- Alternate between them

**Specialization:**
- Create focused templates: "Arm Day", "Back Focus", "Leg Strength"

## What Happens When You Apply a Template?

1. Each exercise in the template is added to your mobile entry for that date in priority order
2. The system suggests weights, sets, and reps based on your training history
3. You can modify everything before logging
