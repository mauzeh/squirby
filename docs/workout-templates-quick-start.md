# Workout Templates - Quick Start Guide

## Tips

### Creating Effective Templates

1. **Name them clearly** - Use descriptive names like "Push Day" or "Monday Workout"
2. **Add descriptions** - Note the focus or difficulty level
3. **Order matters** - Add exercises in the order you'll perform them
4. **Start simple** - Begin with 3-5 exercises per template

### Using Templates Effectively

1. **Create variations** - Make "Heavy" and "Light" versions of the same workout
2. **Plan your week** - Create templates for each training day (Push/Pull/Legs)
3. **Adjust after applying** - Templates are starting points; modify weights as needed
4. **Track what works** - Keep templates that lead to good progress

### Common Use Cases

**Push/Pull/Legs Split:**
- Create 3 templates: Push Day, Pull Day, Leg Day
- Rotate through them 2x per week

**Full Body Routine:**
- Create 2-3 full body templates
- Alternate between them

**Specialization:**
- Create focused templates: "Arm Day", "Back Focus", "Leg Strength"

## What Happens When You Apply a Template?

1. Each exercise in the template is added to your mobile entry for that date
2. The system suggests weights based on your training history
3. Sets and reps from the template are used as defaults
4. You can modify everything before logging
