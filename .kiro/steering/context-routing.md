# Context Routing

When the user's request matches one of these patterns, immediately activate the listed steering files (via `#` context or by reading them directly) before starting work.

## Sync API Work

**Trigger patterns:** User asks to modify sync endpoints, mentions StoreSyncLogAction, SetFieldMapper, ExerciseResolverService, sync auth, pull/push sync, or works on files in `app/Sync/`.

**Activate:**
- `sync-api-context.md` — project context, endpoint inventory, design constraints


## Exercise Type / Log Type Changes

**Trigger patterns:** User modifies `SetFieldMapper.php`, `ExerciseResolverService.php` (especially `deriveExerciseType`), adds a new exercise type strategy in `app/Services/ExerciseTypes/`, changes `config/exercise_types.php`, or mentions exercise type mapping, log type derivation, or field mapping between Athlete and Logger.

**Activate:**
- Read `../../.kiro/steering/cross-app-contracts.md` (root-level) — explains the contract test infrastructure
- After making changes, run `npx vitest --run contracts/__tests__/` from the project root to verify cross-app consistency
- If adding a new logType or changing field mapping: you MUST also update `../../contracts/fixtures/log-type-mapping.json` and the PHP runner at `../../contracts/runners/logger-mapping.php` if the interface changed
- If the change is part of a coordinated cross-app effort governed by a plan at the root workspace
  (`../../docs/plans/`), treat that plan as the source of truth for shared decisions (PR-type/field
  names, data shapes, sequencing) and land this repo's change **in lockstep** with the cross-app contract
  fixtures — never ahead of them. Check for such a plan before starting.


## Architect Mode / Prompt Authoring / Post-Execution Review

**Trigger patterns:** User discusses upcoming features to plan, asks to write an execution prompt for antigravity, brings back code from antigravity for review, discusses roadmap/prioritization, asks to prepare a feature for delegation, mentions "antigravity", "prompt", "architect mode", "hand off", "review the diff", or references `docs/plans/template-prompt.md`.

**Activate:**
- `architect-workflow.md` — prompt precision rules, readiness checklist, post-execution review protocol, cross-repo work
- Read `docs/plans/template-prompt.md` — the prompt template format
- Read `docs/antigravity-steering.md` — the permanent executor contract antigravity reads (esp. §9 plan format, §13 consumer trace, §15 decomposition)


## Telemetry / Dashboard Work

**Trigger patterns:** User asks to modify or extend the telemetry admin dashboard, the telemetry reporting layer, dwell/session/screen analytics, mentions `TelemetryReportService`, `TelemetryApiController`, `telemetry:rollup`, `resources/views/telemetry/`, dashboard performance/cost, rollup/caching of aggregates, screen dwell, session grouping, or works on anything under `app/Telemetry/`.

**Activate:**
- `telemetry-dashboard.md` — performance model (hourly rollup cache + live paginated deep-dive), median/no-unknown dwell rules, `_v` screen normalization, opaque-blob discipline, UI file structure, design/plan references
- Read `../../.kiro/steering/principles.md` (root) — principle #35 (Logger's request path is scarce) is the WHY
- Read the plans: `docs/plans/telemetry-dashboard-dwell.md` (+ `-prompt.md`), `docs/plans/telemetry-dashboard-ui-prompt.md`, and the root spine `../../docs/plans/telemetry-dwell-cross-repo.md`
